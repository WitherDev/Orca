# Orca

Orca API is a discontinued project. It is a Bukkit library that adds commonly used classes and methods to make everyday tasks easier to create in plugins.
This includes, but is not limited to, automated listeners, easier to create commands, menu system, and more.

This project was discontinued in favor of another similar library that has significantly more features.
